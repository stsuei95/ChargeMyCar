# ChargeMyCar

### What is this?

A simple Selenium Python script that automatically signs up for a waitlist spot in your chargepoint account without any intervention. Uses [Amazon lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) to run at a given frequency. 

### Who is it for? 

1. Anyone too lazy to use the official Chargepoint app to get on the waitlist for a station / stations. 
2. Anyone who wants to get on the waitlist at a specific station / stations, but cannot because the charging station doesn't allow auto-queuing :)
